# Archive-Saved-Spotify-Songs
### Still in progress

About once every year, I like to delete all my saved songs and start from scratch, because I get bored want to reset the seed in a way. But I would like to archive those songs so that in the future I can get them again. I think songs can get boring if you over play them but their appeal doesn't get lost, permanently. So it's nice to go back to the archives and pick out old tracks.

To that effect, this is a simple app that saves your songs in a csv, which in fact can be later loaded into a new playlist or your current saved songs, also programmatically (I'll work on that next).

Cheers
